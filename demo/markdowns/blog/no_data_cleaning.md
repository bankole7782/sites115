# No Data Cleaning
**Date: 2nd January 2023**

Data Cleaning is this step in data analysis where records that are out of the structure
are either rectified or deleted.

## Why are we suggesting **No Data Cleaning**?

Data Cleaning simply implies that the data was not well collected. That is not the best 
means were used in collected the data.

## So What Next?

### Point 1
The right way to collect data is to **get a programmer and create a form on a website**. 
This is quite easy to do and is really not even close to rocket science.

I strongly suggest creating a form by a programmer than using some of these weird low-code
tools. This is because of validation.

Some validation which can be quite difficult for low-code tools to accomplish includes:

* Checking if the data is included from another lists (common term is foreign keys)

* Checking if the data follows some rules. Like in my university our matric numbers where like CSC/2008/072

### Point 2
It is far better for **the owner of the data to enter the data by himself / herself into the form**.
This helps in keeping the data very accurate. Since the owner of the data would recognise his data
quite well and be able to check if the right data is entered.

I remember not long ago, in a Government Office setting. Someone was asking for my data and entering it into 
the computer. Only to later notice that the bank account was wrong by one number.
